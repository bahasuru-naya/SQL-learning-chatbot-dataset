# SQL Learning Assistant 🤖💬

## Overview
**SQL Learning Assistant** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to help students and developers learn SQL through interactive, natural language conversations. Built with the **Rasa framework**, it translates user intents into real-time database operations, allowing users to practice CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions and data analysis without needing to write complex SQL syntax manually.

The assistant provides a modern, user-friendly interface with integrated voice Support, making the learning experience both dynamic and accessible.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Natural Language to SQL**: Interactively query the database using plain English.
- **Real-time Database Interaction**: Perform `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations directly through the chat.
- **Advanced Data Analysis**: Ask for insights like "show details about sales of each item" and get formatted tabular results.
- **Voice-Enabled Learning**: Built-in **Speech-to-Text** and **Text-to-Speech** (Voice) capabilities for hands-free interaction.
- **Modern Dashboard**: Responsive web interface with:
  - **Dark Mode** support for comfortable viewing.
  - **Database Schema Visualization** to understand table structures.
  - **Smart Suggestions** to help users get started with common commands.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

### 🔹 Backend (Logic & NLU)
- **Rasa Open Source**: Manages Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and dialogue policies.
- **Python SDK (rasa-sdk)**: Handles custom actions for database connectivity.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM used to interface with the MySQL database.

### 🔹 Frontend (User Interface)
- **HTML5 & Vanilla CSS**: Premium, responsive UI design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles real-time DOM updates and voice processing.
- **Socket.io**: Enables low-latency, bi-directional communication between the UI and Rasa server.

### 🔹 Database
- **MySQL**: Persistent storage for stock, prices, and sales data.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 - 3.10
- MySQL Server
- Node.js (for Socket.io communication)

### 2. Database Configuration
1. Create a MySQL database named `csitem`.
2. Ensure your credentials match those in `actions/actions.py` (default: `username: 'root'`, `password: 'bahasurubn0008'`).
3. Set up your tables (e.g., `stock`, `price`, `sales`).

### 3. Backend Setup
Install the required Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Assistant
You need to run the Rasa server and the Action server concurrently.

**Start Rasa Server:**
```bash
rasa run --enable-api --cors "*"
```

**Start Custom Actions Server:**
```bash
rasa run actions
```

### 5. Frontend Deployment
Simply open `Frontend/index.html` in your web browser. Ensure the Rasa server is running on `http://localhost:5005`.
